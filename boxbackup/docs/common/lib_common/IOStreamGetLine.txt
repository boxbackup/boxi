CLASS IOStreamGetLine

This class provides a convenient way to read text from a file, line by line. It also can preprocess the line to remove leading and trailing whitespace and comments. Comments are started by the character # and run to the end of the line.

Create an instance by passing a reference to a stream into the constructor.

Note the class does internal buffering, so you can only detach it later if the stream supports seeking backwards.


FUNCTION IOStreamGetLine::GetLine()

Returns true if a line could be retreieved without a read timing out.


FUNCTION IOStreamGetLine::IsEOF()

Whether the end of the stream has been reached. Do not call GetLine if this is true.


FUNCTION IOStreamGetLine::GetLineNumber()

Returns the line number.


FUNCTION IOStreamGetLine::DetachFile()

Detaches the stream from the GetLine class. Will seek backwards to "replace" data it's buffered back in the stream.
