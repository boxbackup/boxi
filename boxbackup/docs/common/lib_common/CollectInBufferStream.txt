CLASS CollectInBufferStream

This class is essentially a buffer. Data is written to it, and stored in memory. Then when all data is written which will be written, it can be read out again.

Useful for building streams in memory.


FUNCTION CollectInBufferStream::SetForReading()

After you've written all the data, call this to set it to read mode.


FUNCTION CollectInBufferStream::Reset()

Reset the stream to the state where is has no data, and is about to have data written.


FUNCTION CollectInBufferStream::GetSize()

Get the size of the buffered data -- the entire data. Use the interface function BytesLeftToRead() in most cases. 


FUNCTION CollectInBufferStream::GetBuffer()

Get the buffer, so you can do bad things with it if you're feeling naughty.
