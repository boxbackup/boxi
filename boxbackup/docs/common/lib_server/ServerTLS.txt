CLASS ServerTLS

Implements a server which uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt and authenticate connections.

Very similar to ServerStream, except it reads the certificate files for the TLSContext out of the Server sub-configuration to set up a TLSContext ("CertificateFile", "PrivateKeyFile" and "TrustedCAsFile"). Otherwise works exactly the same.
