CLASS RaidFileWrite

Interface to writing raidfiles.

See IOStream interface.

Some other useful functions are available, see h and cpp files.


FUNCTION RaidFileWrite::RaidFileWrite()

The constructor takes the disc set number and filename of the file you're interested.


FUNCTION RaidFileWrite::Open()

Open() opens the file for writing, and takes an "allow overwrite" flag.


FUNCTION RaidFileWrite::Commit()

Commmit the file, and make it visible to RaidFileRead. If ConvertToRaidNow == true, it will be converted to raid file representation immediately.

Setting it to false is not a good idea. Later on, it will tell a daemon to convert it in the background, but for now it simply won't be converted.


FUNCTION RaidFileWrite::Discard()

Abort the creation/update. Equivalent to just deleting the object without calling Commit().


FUNCTION RaidFileWrite::Delete()

Delete a file -- don't need to Open() it first.
