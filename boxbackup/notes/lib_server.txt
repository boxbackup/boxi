TITLE lib/server

This provides various classes for implementing client/server applications (and UNIX daemons).

The stars of the show are ServerTLS and Protocol, which allow client server applications which communicate using TLS (SSL successor) to be built with surprisingly few lines of code.

All details in the respective class files.

Look at test/basicserver for examples.
