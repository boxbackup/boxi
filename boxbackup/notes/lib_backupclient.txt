TITLE lib/backupclient

Classes used on the store and on the server.

See documentation in the files for more details.


SUBTITLE BackupStoreDirectory

The directory listing class, containing a number of entries, representing files.


SUBTITLE BackupStoreFile

Handles compressing and encrypting files, and decoding files downloaded from the server.


SUBTITLE BackupStoreFilename

An encrypted filename.


SUBTITLE BackupStoreFilenameClear

Derived from BackupStoreFilename, but with the ability to encrypt and decrypt filenames. Client side only.


SUBTITLE BackupClientFileAttributes

Only used on the client -- the server treats attributes as blocks of opaque data.

This reads attributes from files on discs, stores them, encrypts them, and applies them to new files.

Also has a static function to generate filename attribute hashes given a struct stat and the filename.


SUBTITLE BackupClientRestore

Routines to restore files from the server onto the client filesystem.


SUBTITLE BackupClientCryptoKeys

This reads the key material from disc, and sets up the crypto for storing files, attributes and directories.
