For instructions on building an RPM of Box Backup, see the contrib/rpm
directory. This is primarily for RedHat style systems, but notes are provided
on what needs to be modified for SUSE.


Requirements:

	OpenSSL 0.9.7

Require zlib and openssl headers for compilation -- may not be included when
installing the packages. (libssl-dev + libz-dev packages under debian)

Bekerley DB v1 or v4 support is required. The configure script should find an
appropriate db package -- and if not, use an in-memory version of the code.
However, the in-memory version is not desirable as it will lose information
over restarts of the daemon.

Ideally, use libeditline as a readline replacement. If not available then use
GNU readline (libreadline4-dev, probably) and pass --enable-gnu-readline to
./configure.



(OpenSSL 0.9.7 is required as it implements new interfaces which make encryption
using the same key faster by avoiding key setup each time around. Configure it with
./config shared , then copy the libs and headers into the required places.)
