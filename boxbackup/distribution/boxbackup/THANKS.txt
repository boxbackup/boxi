The following developers contributed code to version 0.10:

Nick Knight
  - ported Box Backup to Windows (properly, not using Cygwin)
 
Gary Niemcewicz
  - added client/server (SSL) keepalives to keep the connection to the
    server alive during a long diff, and saving the daemon's state across restarts

Martin Ebourne
  - ported to Solaris; wrote extended attribute support (xattr);
    converted to use autoconf for automatic compiler configuration.

Chris Wilson
  - updated Nick's and Gary's work to fit in with the new trunk,
    fixed some issues pointed out by Ben and Martin, made it compile
    on Windows with the free MinGW compiler.

Jonathan Morton
  - vastly improved the performance and efficiency of the file-diffing code, and
    obtained a free G5 PowerMac from IBM as his reward.
