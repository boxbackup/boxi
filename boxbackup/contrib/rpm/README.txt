BUILDING AN RPM

The easy way is to:

rpmbuild -ta <tarfile>

where <tarfile> is the archive you downloaded of Box Backup.

This RPM should work on RedHat Enterprise, Fedora Core, Mandrake, SUSE, and
any similar distributions. It has been developed and tested on Fedora Core.

Changes for SUSE Linux were provided by Chris Smith
