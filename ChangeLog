	* ChangeLog, README, TODO, include/main.h:
	- Updated for release of 0.0.6pre1

	* configure.in:
	- Added position marker for boxbackup patch patch

	* configure.in, make-dist.sh:
	-More bug fixes

	* make-dist.sh:
	- More bug fixes

	* make-dist.sh:
	- Typo fix

	* make-dist.sh:
	- Diff the BoxBackup CVS against pristine sources to generate a patch for release
	- Apply that patch when building boxi

	* src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Fixed call to GetClientPid to handle new return codes properly

	* src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Normalise path to boxi, to help find the boxbackup executable

	* src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Reduced debug logging verbosity
	- Fixed KillClient command

2005-04-26  Chris Wilson

	* include/ClientConfig.h:
	- Disabled ClientConfig's copy constructor for safety

2005-04-25  Chris Wilson

	* README, README.pod, make-dist.sh:
	- Renamed README.pod back to README, as Make insists on building it
	- Renamed README to README.txt (in make-dist.sh)

	* boxi.prj:
	- Disable overwriting configure.in and src/Makefile.am, to preserve custom changes for the Cygwin build

	* configure.in:
	- Hacked by hand to remove test for GTK, not relevant on Win32

	* include/BackupFilesPanel.h:
	- Added missing include of wx/imaglist.h

	* include/ClientConnection.h,
	  src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Added new ClientConnection error codes, and used them
	- Added process existence check to GetClientPid()
	- Fixed StopClient to stop the client, not start it :-)
	- Fixed (I hope) PID file reading error, which was returning wrong PIDs sometimes
	- Changed GetClientPid to return an Error, not bool

	* include/ClientConnection.h,
	  src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Renamed ST_ states to BST_

	* src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Renamed ST_ states to BST_, to avoid conflict with a Win32 macro

	* src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Changed use of ClientConnection::GetClientPid() to match new Error return

	* src/BackupFilesPanel.cc:
	- Changed to use GNU regex library instead of PCRE

	* src/Makefile.am:
	- Removed -DNDEBUG, which causes build errors against a debugging build of wx 2.4. Will have to find another solution for Cygwin

	* src/Makefile.am:
	- Hacked by hand to compile on Cygwin

	* src/Restore.cc:
	- Removed dependency on Box Backup's debug tracing code

	* src/ServerFilesPanel.cc:
	- Removed dependency on lldiv, which doesn't exist in Cygwin?

2005-04-24  Chris Wilson

	* boxbackup/bin/bbackupd/CommandSocketManager.cpp:
	- Avoid pinging the command socket client when waiting with no timeout, to avoid flooding the connection during idle polling

	* boxbackup/infrastructure/makebuildenv.pl:
	- Fixed compiler flags when compiling in debug (not release) mode

	* include/BackupDaemonPanel.h,
	  src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Added more text boxes for status display
	- Added ability to forcibly kill client
	- Improved button layout
	- Disable buttons which aren't useful in the current state

	* include/BackupDaemonPanel.h,
	  src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Implemented buttons to restart, sync and reload client

	* include/ClientConnection.h,
	  src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Added strings for worker and client states
	- Added methods to retrieve state strings
	- Added method to forcibly kill client
	- Improved concurrency: most worker code runs without holding locks on mMutex
	- Improved design simplicity and safety
	- Moved some methods from header to source file

	* include/ClientConnection.h,
	  src/ClientConnection.cc:
	- Factored out some duplicate code
	- Added ability to restart, sync and reload bbackupd

2005-04-22  Chris Wilson

	* Makefile.am, boxi.prj,
	  include/Makefile.am, po/POTFILES.in:
	- Integrated Box Backup build with GNU automess
	- Added ClientConnection to sources

	* boxbackup/bin/bbackupctl/bbackupctl.cpp,
	  boxbackup/bin/bbackupd/BackupDaemon.cpp,
	  boxbackup/bin/bbackupd/CommandSocketManager.h,
	  configure.in, test/config/bbackupd.conf:
	- Listen to command socket when sleeping after a backup error

	* boxbackup/bin/bbackupd/CommandSocketManager.cpp:
	- Trace when a new connection from a control client is established

	* boxbackup/lib/common/DebugMemLeakFinder.cpp:
	- Fixed signedness warning when compiling boxbackup

	* include/BackupDaemonPanel.h,
	  src/BackupDaemonPanel.cc:
	- Moved client control functions to a separate class, ClientConnection

	* include/ClientConnection.h,
	  src/ClientConnection.cc:
	New file.

	* include/main.h:
	- Added IDs for client daemon controls and timer events

	- Added an item to fix compile on Cygwin

	* boxbackup/lib/common/DebugMemLeakFinder.cpp:
	- Fixed buffer overflow in DebugMemLeakFinder

	* include/Property.h:
	- Replace stringstream formatting with wxString, since sstream doesn't seem to work on Cygwin

	* make-dist.sh:
	- Current directory might not be in the PATH

	* src/BackupFilesPanel.cc:
	- Include iostream for std::cout

	* src/ServerFilesPanel.cc:
	- Include wx/imaglist.h, needed to build on Cygwin (Gary <gniemcew@yahoo.com>)
