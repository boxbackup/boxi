=head1 To Do List

Boxi is a work in progress, and many features are not implemented yet.
Patches, suggestions and comments are most welcome, but please check
this list before proposing a "new" feature, to make sure that it really
is new.

=item *
Implement the Compare function.

Allows users to determine whether their files have been backed up,
and whether they should be backed up according to the configuration.

=item *
Display properties of server objects

When a file or directory on the server is selected, we should show
everything we know about it, including last modification date, other versions,
Box Backup flags, size in blocks and bytes, etc.

=item *
Show progress dialog while restoring files

Show in a separate window, allow restore operations to be cancelled.

=item *
Provide dialog boxes for selecting paths

Several config items specify paths of files or directories.
It should be possible to enter these using a dialog box to select
a file or directory, instead of requiring the user to memorise
and enter the path.

=item *
Prompt to save changes

When closing Boxi, if the configuration has changed, ask the user whether
they want to save it. Also ask before restarting Box Backup daemon.

=item *
Provide a better GUI for adding and removing backup locations.

=item *
Stricter error checking of the configuration

Warn users of configuration errors, before connecting to the server. 
Especially those errors which could cause Box Backup to fail to start!

=item *
Default location for configuration file 

Look for the configuration file in /etc/boxbackup/bbackupd.conf, if it's
not specified on the command line.

=item *
Cache directory listings on the client

Avoids the need to requery the server, when browsing a directory 
whose contents we downloaded before.

=item *
Fix Cygwin bugs

Missing tree icons in Local Files and Server Files.
Location matching in Local Files. 
Kill button in Backup Daemon Panel.
