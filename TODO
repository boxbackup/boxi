=head1 To Do List

Boxi is a work in progress, and many features are not implemented yet.
Patches, suggestions and comments are most welcome, but please check
this list before proposing a "new" feature, to make sure that it really
is new.

=over

=item *
Implement the Compare function.

Allows users to determine whether their files have been backed up,
and whether they should be backed up according to the configuration.

=item *
Display properties of server objects

When a file or directory on the server is selected, we should show
everything we know about it, including last modification date, other versions,
Box Backup flags, size in blocks and bytes, etc.

=item *
Show progress dialog while restoring files

Show in a separate window, allow restore operations to be cancelled.

=item *
Prompt to save changes in configuration

If the configuration has changed, ask the user whether they want to
save it and reload the Box Backup daemon, and reconnect to the server.

=item *
Stricter error checking of the configuration

Warn users of configuration errors, before connecting to the server. 
Especially those errors which could cause Box Backup to fail to start!

Better error messages if we can't connect to the server (connection
refused or connection timed out). Preferably display a dialog with
progress information and allow the user to cancel the operation.

=item *
Default location for configuration file 

Look for the configuration file in /etc/boxbackup/bbackupd.conf, if it's
not specified on the command line.

=item *
Cache directory listings on the client

Avoids the need to requery the server, when browsing a directory 
whose contents we downloaded before.

=item *
Fix Cygwin bugs

Missing tree icons in Local Files and Server Files.
Location matching in Local Files. 
Kill button in Backup Daemon Panel.

=item *
Allow restoring old versions of files

Fix all references to GetMostRecent() in ServerFilesPanel

=item *
Restore selection bug

Select a node (it becomes ticked), then select its parent, then try
toggling the first node (it doesn't toggle properly).

=item *
Fix the read/write issue

When a read-write connection is needed, we should disconnect and
downgrade to a read-only connection as soon as it's finished, to make
way for bbackupd.

=item *
Fix abort on clicking Add Exclusion with no path entered

=item *
Convert the std::strings in Location.h to wxStrings

=item *
Fix inability to select socket and PID file that don't exist using
file selection dialog

=item *
Allow copying of error messages from list box in backup progress panel.

=item *
Investigate files being restored with wrong timestamps (4 hours in the future)
reported by Pete Jalajas.

=item *
Remove the View menu, or make it work.
