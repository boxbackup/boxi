Please see docs/README.html (or docs/README.txt) for a lot of information
about Boxi. Thanks!

CVS users, please see docs/README.pod, the source from which the above files
are generated. It's quite readable, I promise! :-) You can generate HTML
and text versions, if you have Perl installed, with the following commands:

	pod2html docs/README.pod -t "Boxi README" --noindex > README.html

	pod2text docs/README.pod                            > README.txt
