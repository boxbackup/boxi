      <title>About Boxi and Box Backup</title>

      <para><application>Boxi</application> is a graphical program that 
      allows you to back up your files across the Internet (or a local 
      network) to a <application>Box Backup</application> server.</para>

      <para><application>Box Backup</application> is a software program 
      for systems administrators to back up their files efficiently and 
      securely across the Internet.</para>

      <para><application>Boxi</application> is fully compatible with 
      <application>Box Backup</application>, the command-line backup 
      tool, but <application>Boxi</application> is designed to be as 
      easy to use as possible.</para>

      <para><application>Boxi</application> uses the same configuration 
      files as <application>Box Backup</application>, to make it easy 
      to switch between the two.</para>

      <para><application>Boxi</application> supports the same security 
      and efficiency as <application>Box Backup</application>, and also 
      requires a server where your backups will be stored, usually on 
      the Internet.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>Storage</title>

      <para><application>Boxi</application> stores your data on a 
      server, rather than on a disk or tape like a conventional backup 
      system. This is very convenient because you don&apos;t have to do 
      anything at all to back up your data. It just happens 
      automatically in the background.</para>

      <para>You can run your own server, but this requires considerable 
      technical skill, and <application>Boxi</application> is designed 
      for ordinary users. We expect that you will want to get an 
      agreement with a server operator, to use the bandwidth and disk 
      space of their server for your backups.</para>

      <para>The server would normally be connected somewhere else on 
      the Internet, so that if your computer catches fire, your data 
      stays cool. This means that you have a very wide choice of 
      potential server operators, so you should be able to get a good 
      deal. If your requirements are low, you can probably find a 
      friend who has a server and will let you use it for your 
      backups.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>Security</title>

      <para><application>Box Backup</application> is secure because it 
      encrypts your files before sending them to the server. Nobody, 
      not even the server operator, can read your files.</para>

      <warning>

        <title>Keep your keys safe</title>

        <para>Your files on the server are encrypted with a strong 
        encryption key, which is stored in a file. If you lose this 
        key, then there is absolutely no way to access your files, and 
        your backups are useless. You <emphasis>must</emphasis> keep 
        extra copies of the key file safe places, such as in the trust 
        of friends.</para>

      </warning>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>

      <title>Efficiency</title>

      <para><application>Box Backup</application> is efficient because 
      it doesn&apos;t upload files which have not changed. You can back 
      up gigabytes of data over a standard ADSL internet connection to 
      a server hosted somewhere on the Internet.</para>

  <chapter id="install">

    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>This chapter describes how to install <application>
    Boxi</application> on your computer.</para>

    <para>Most computers are unfortunately not supplied with 
    <application>Boxi</application> already installed. Therefore, you 
    will have to download and install it yourself.</para>

    <para>The easiest way to install <application>Boxi</application> is 
    to download a pre-compiled version for your computer. The available 
    pre-compiled versions are listed on the 
    <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net">Boxi website</ulink>. 
    Typically they would include the latest versions of <application>
    Boxi</application> for Windows, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu Linux, 
    since these are the versions that us developers have on our 
    computers. Other people may contribute builds for different 
    operating systems from time to time, but these may not be quite as 
    recent.</para>

    <para>If the latest version of <application>Boxi</application> is 
    not available for your computer, but an older version is available, 
    then you should check the list of changes on the website to 
    determine whether any important bugs have been fixed since that 
    older version was released. If so, you might like to build a new 
    version of Boxi yourself, or request that we build one for you, or 
    find someone else who can do it for you.</para>

    <para>Please decide whether you want to use a pre-compiled version, 
    or compile one yourself, before proceeding with the installation. 
    If in doubt, please 
    <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net/contact.html">contact 
    us</ulink>.</para>

    <sect1>

      <title>Installing a Pre-Compiled Version</title>

      <para>Pre-compiled versions should be easy to install. All 
      versions are distributed as a single file which you will need to 
      download from our <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net">
      website</ulink>. We strongly recommend that you download an 
      official copy from our website, rather than using any other 
      version you might find on the Internet, to protect yourself from 
      potentially corrupt or dangerous versions that you might find 
      online.</para>

      <sect2>

        <title>Microsoft Windows</title>

        <para><application>Windows</application> versions are 
        distributed in a <application>ZIP</application> file, which 
        newer versions of <application>Windows</application> (XP and 
        above) can handle automatically. For older versions, you will 
        need to download a program like 
        <ulink url="http://www.7-zip.org">7-Zip</ulink> to decompress 
        it. We hope to provide a proper installer soon, which would 
        allow you to install <application>Boxi</application> just by 
        double-clicking on it.</para>

        <para>To install, just double-click on the downloaded file, 
        drag out the <filename>Boxi</filename> folder from inside it, 
        and drop it somewhere convenient, for example on your desktop, 
        or in your <filename>Program Files</filename> folder. Enter the 
        folder, and if required, drag the <filename>Boxi</filename> 
        program icon to your desktop or start menu, to help you start 
        Boxi easily.</para>

        <para>Once you have configured Boxi, you can set it to run as a 
        Windows service, which means that it will start automatically 
        when you switch on your computer.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

        <title>Linux</title>

        <para>Most Linux systems use a <application>package 
        manager</application> to manage installed software. It&apos;s 
        better to install a package that&apos;s compatible with your 
        package manager, rather than a binary <application>
        tar</application> file, so that you can remove or upgrade 
        <application>Boxi</application> easily using the package 
        manager.</para>

        <sect3>

          <title>RPM systems (Red Hat, Fedora, SuSE, Mandriva)</title>

          <para>First, download an <application>RPM</application> 
          package for your system, or one that seems likely to be 
          compatible with it. Downloading the wrong version will not 
          cause any harm, but the package may not install, or may not 
          run once installed, so if in doubt, download a few different 
          versions and try them.</para>

          <para>Use the <application>rpm</application> command to 
          install the package:</para>

          <synopsis>rpm -ivh boxi-xxx.rpm</synopsis>
          <para>The output should be something like:</para>

          <screen>Preparing... ####################### [100%]
boxi         ####################### [100%]</screen>
          <para>If the output indicates that some requirements are 
          missing, you may be able to use your distribution&apos;s 
          package management system to install them. If not, please try 
          a different package. If you can&apos;t find one that works, 
          please <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net/contact.html">
          contact us</ulink>.</para>

          <para>Once the package is installed, you should be able to 
          start <application>Boxi</application> just by running the 
          command:</para>

          <synopsis>boxi</synopsis>
          <para>If this fails for any reason, please 
          <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net/contact.html">contact 
          us</ulink>.</para>

          <para>If you already have an older version of <application>
          Boxi</application> installed, you may need to remove it 
          first. The <application>RPM</application> package manager 
          should complain and refuse to install another version if one 
          is already installed. You can remove an existing package 
          using the command:</para>

          <synopsis>rpm -ev package-name</synopsis>
        </sect3>

        <sect3>

          <title>Debian and Ubuntu systems</title>

          <para><application>Debian</application> systems use the 
          Debian package manager <application>dpkg</application> to 
          install and remove packages. The procedure is similar to the 
          one described for <application>RPM</application> packages 
          above, but the command to install a package is:</para>

          <synopsis>dpkg -i boxi-xxx.deb</synopsis>
          <para>And to remove a package:</para>

          <synopsis>dpkg -e boxi</synopsis>
        </sect3>

      </sect2>

    </sect1>

      <title>Building from Source</title>

      <para>The other way to install Boxi is to download and compile 
      the source code. You will probably want to do this if:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem><para>No pre-compiled version of <application>
        Boxi</application> is available for your system;</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>The latest available pre-compiled version is too 
        old;</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>You want to inspect or modify the source 
        code;</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>You want to participate in <application>
        Boxi</application> development.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>You will need a number of software tools installed on your 
      computer before you can build Boxi.</para>

      <sect2>

        <title>Cygwin</title>

        <para>Windows users will need a number of Unix tools installed 
        on their system in order to compile <application>
        Boxi</application>. The easiest way to get these tools is to 
        install <application>Cygwin</application> by Cygnus Solutions. 
        Unix users do not need to install <application>
        Cygwin</application>.</para>

        <para><application>Boxi</application> does not depend on 
        <application>Cygwin</application> once compiled, and can easily 
        be installed on computers without <application>
        Cygwin</application>, but the tools are an important part of 
        the compilation process.</para>

        <para>To install <application>Cygwin</application>, download 
        and run the <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe">Cygwin 
        installer</ulink>. As part of the installation process, you 
        will need to select some packages to install.</para>

        <para>You should select at least the following packages:</para>

        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem><para>Archive/tar</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>Devel/gcc-mingw-g++</para></listitem>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

        <title>C++ Compiler</title>

        <para><application>Boxi</application> is normally compiled with 
        the free software compiler 
        <ulink url="http://directory.fsf.org/devel/compilers/gcc.html">
        <application>GCC</application></ulink>, which is supplied with 
        most Linux distributions. <application>Windows</application> 
        users should install <ulink url="http://www.mingw.org">
        <application>MinGW</application></ulink> through <application>
        Cygwin</application>, as above, and ignore this step.</para>

        <para>It should be possible to compile Boxi with other C++ 
        compilers, but most compilers (including the above) have quirks 
        or non-standard behaviours, so you should expect to have some 
        problems, and you may need to modify the source code to make it 
        work. If you use a different compiler, please 
        <ulink url="http://boxi.sourceforge.net/contact.html">contact 
        us</ulink> to let us know how it went.</para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2>

        <title>Perl</title>

        <para><application>Boxi</application> depends on Box Backup, 
        which in turn requires <application>Perl</application> to build 
        some of the libraries.</para>

        <para>Most Linux and Unix-like systems will be supplied with a 
        version of Perl, or have one easily available. You should just have
        to install the <filename>perl</filename> package.</para>

        <title>OpenSSL</title>
	
        <para><application>OpenSSL</application> is a cryptography library
        which <application>Boxi</application> uses to keep your data safe,
        both in transit over the network, and stored on the server.</para>
        
        <para>Most Linux and Unix-like systems will have a version of
        OpenSSL available, including the development libraries and headers

      <title>The Server</title>
      
      <para><application>Boxi</application> backs up your data to a server,
      that is a computer that's always on and always connected to the 
      Internet. You can back up to a local server (on your local network) 
      instead, but most of the benefits of <application>Boxi</application> 
      are not very useful in this case. For example, encryption of backups
      is most useful when you don't control the server, and bandwidth 
      efficiency is most useful when you have a low-bandwidth connection 
      between you and the server.</para>
      
      <para>The server needs to be running the 
      <application>Box Backup</application> server software. Normally, we 
      expect that you would have a contract with someone who operates a
      server, and runs a <application>Box Backup</application> service on
      it. Normally, your contract would specify the amount of storage
      space on the server that is available to you.</para>
